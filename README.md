# Life Science Training Slack

#### *[lifescitraining.slack.com](https://lifescitraining.slack.com)*


## What is #LifeSciTraining Slack?

*A way to connect anyone and everyone who does training in the life sciences to share resources, advice, and conversation - all in the service of improving our teaching and our careers.*

**This is an experiment** - Hopefully Slack is a forum that makes it easy for many to participate without being a burden. My guess is it will be low-volume, but maybe some people will find help, collaborations, or friends! People in this community might be PIs or professors but many (most?) of them are not. This is a way to carve out space for those not necessarily doing for-credit/semester-long training (although maybe you teach those classes too).

**This is a community for all life sciences** - Are you an ecologist? a microscopist? Do you work at the bench, or on a cluster? Are you a graduate student, an undergraduate, a robot? Is short-format training your career,  something you do every summer, or something you are about to do? As long as your training is about a life science discipline, you belong here!

## How to join #LifeSciTraining Slack

Use this [invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/lifescitraining/shared_invite/enQtNDc2NDk2NzMyNjkyLTE0NTRmNzBkYTIxZTBjNWIzNDhjZjc0MjU1MmFjZDNiMWI5MWQ4MTQxMDA3MDg1OGFjNzlhOGY4NWY2NjczMmM)

## What are some things to do on #LifeSciTraining Slack

- Let people know you exist!
- Ask for help about creating or teaching a workshop
- Share tips for organizing a workshop
- Discuss how to evaluate and assess your impact
- Introduce your training materials and get feedback
- Seek advice on the role of training in your career


## What are some things not to do on #LifeSciTraining Slack (Code of Conduct)

This may evolve, but here is a starting point for joining.

- **Don't be rude**: no insults, profanity, harassment, attacks of any kind.
- **Keep focused**: Keep conversation on the #general channel focused on Life Science training topics
- **Don't mansplain**: When feedback is *requested* keep criticism professional and respectful. Don't push your opinions on how something should be done. Where possible present objective (ideally published) evidence.

## #LifeSciTraining Slack Registry

**Identification is optional** - You can still participate on the Slack, but I thought it would be cool if there was a registry of people that would be searchable.  Feel free to identify here by filling out this [google form](https://goo.gl/forms/ZBW1Vln3RXs5uvTx1). Contact [Jason Williams](mailto:williams@cshl.edu) to edit or remove your entry from the list, or file a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/LifeSciTrainingSlack).

## Who started this and where is this going?

Me, Jason (@JasonWilliamsNY). I don't want to own it - it belongs to everyone. Let's see if it grows and is useful! If this takes off, we can talk about some more formal community roles/mechanisms and maybe even meet-ups! Share your ideas on Slack
